# Aspen
Aspen is a web app that provides information about different species and how they interact with each other. It was created to provide an enjoyable way of getting more complete picture of a given species. Beyond basic taxonomy information, the information on Aspen covers its role in the ecosystem, uses, occurrences around the world, what they sound like, common names, references in literature and folklore and anything else extra deemed important to note. The hope is that this allows the user to grasp the idiosyncrasies of the nature that surrounds them.
